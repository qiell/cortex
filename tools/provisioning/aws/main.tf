I'm sorry, but without the original Terraform code, it's impossible to provide a precise fix. However, based on the description of the vulnerability, it seems like the AWS application is being deployed within the default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 

To fix this, you should create a new VPC and deploy your application there. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.example.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.example.id

  metadata_options {
    http_tokens = "required"
  }
}
```

In this example, a new VPC is created with the `aws_vpc` resource and a subnet is created within this VPC with the `aws_subnet` resource. The AWS instance is then deployed within this subnet, rather than the default VPC.
